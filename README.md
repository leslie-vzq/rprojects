# rprojects
This repository is a collection of projects that I have worked on in R since my undergraduate years as a Statistics major.
It includes graphing, modeling, and interpretation of the data with linear and logistic regression for the main models.

The two projects are:
* logistic regression on consumption data with subquestions in the form of a mid progress presentation and full report
  * teamwork: 
    * I contributed with the age subquestion portion, parts of the main question, and parts of organizing all the parts
    * Creating age column from birth year, grouped into age groups, histograms to compare, considered outliers
    * k means clustering
    * logistic regression assumption check, logistic regression model, backwards model selection
    * pairwise comparison tukey, cross validation approach, confusion matrix, conclusion/interpretation
  * original data: our original data had various consumption products and various shopper characteristics
  * new data: 
    * response variable - amount of fruit consumed in a year
    * predictors - age, income, education, number of kids at home, marital status
  * main question: What characteristics make someone more likely to purchase fruits?
  * exploratory analysis
  * assumptions
  * interpretation of final model and subquestion conclusions
  
* linear regression model on hospital data to select the covariates and possible higher order terms for the model
  * independent work
  * original data: 
    * response variable - average infection risk in hospital
    * predictors - average number of beds in hospital, average number of facilities in each hospital, whether the hospital is part of a medical school
  * exploratory analysis
  * assumptions
  * anova
  * interpretation of final model and reasoning for steps
  * written model equation
